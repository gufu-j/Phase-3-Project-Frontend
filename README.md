<h1> Bakery Manager App </h1>


This frontend bakery app is a simple app created to manage different bakeries and their breads at various locations. The whole point of this app is mainly concerned with adding the bread available at each bakery including their price and type of bread. This includes adding different bakeries with different names and locations all very organized and easy to handle with buttons to assist the user.  
This App was created with a database managed by Ruby. This means that all CRUD interactions (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) performed at the frontend are likely to be captured and tracked by the backend. This makes our system more efficient and even better to interact with because it's working fully on its own. That being said, let's check out the way the app looks.

In the picture below, one can see the way the main page of the app looks like. It has a classy old style and buttons. Sentences are also easy to read and see. Here, the user can type down the name of the bakery and location, then hit add bakery. This will add a bakery automatically and with the same style as the rest on the list of bakeries- yellow charts- below.

If the user types wrong the name and location or decides to edit it eventually, the user can press Edit Bakery. Once that happens a modal will pop up allowing the user to change the name of the bakery and location and hit " Press Here to Update ".

If the user is interested in deleting a bakery completely, he/she can easily hit "Delete". 

Now... here is when it comes to the best part!! 


If the user wishes to see the different types of  bread, price, and name of each bakery, clicking on "Breads" will allow this. Once there, one is able to add breads and keep track of it along with the rest. For now, in the picture below, you will see the way this section looks like, notice that some space has been left for adding more features to the app.

Although this may seem to be a pretty simple app it has a very complex structure coming all the way from Ruby along with React. They both need each other to make all this happens. This project consisted mainly in building the database and then building a simple app to interact with it. Either simple or complex, nobody can deny how beautiful and nice are the things that can be done with ruby and react!
